#Future Plan

**My future plan in this website:**
I want to make sure this website fully pictured my journey and story in learning how to be a professional full stack javascript developer. So, in the future plan of this website, I want to write a lot of story and my own reflection on my journey so other people that has the same interest as me (JS, web development) will benefit and at least learn from my experience. I hope also this website will help people like me!
